Window Object:
Definition: The window object represents the browser window or frame. It acts as the global context for JavaScript code running within that window.

Scope: The window object encompasses the entire browser window, including the document, frames, and various properties and methods related to the window itself.

Functionality:

Navigation: Provides methods like window.open() and window.close() for opening and closing browser windows.
Interaction: Facilitates interaction with the browser environment, such as handling events (window.onload, window.onresize) and timeouts (window.setTimeout, window.setInterval).
Access to Global Variables: Global variables and functions are properties and methods of the window object. For instance, window.alert(), window.console.log().
Screen Object:
Definition: The screen object represents the user's screen or display device.

Scope: It provides information about the user's screen dimensions and properties.

Functionality:

Screen Dimensions: Properties like screen.width and screen.height provide the dimensions of the user's screen.
Pixel Depth: screen.colorDepth and screen.pixelDepth provide information about the color depth of the display.
Orientation: screen.orientation provides information about the screen's orientation.
Document Object:
Definition: The document object represents the web page loaded in the browser window.

Scope: It provides access to the HTML document's structure and content.

Functionality:

DOM Manipulation: Allows access to elements within the document, enabling manipulation of their properties, styles, and content.
Event Handling: Provides methods for handling events within the document, such as document.addEventListener() and document.removeEventListener().
Element Selection: Methods like document.getElementById(), document.querySelector(), and document.querySelectorAll() facilitate selecting elements within the document.
Form Access: Allows access to form elements and their properties, such as document.forms and form.elements.
Key Differences:
Scope:
window: Represents the browser window or frame.
screen: Represents the user's screen or display device.
document: Represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
Functionality:
window: Handles interactions and events related to the browser window.
screen: Provides information about the user's screen properties.
document: Allows access to and manipulation of the HTML document's structure and content.
Understanding the differences between these objects is crucial for effectively leveraging their functionalities in JavaScript web development. They each play distinct roles in creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.
